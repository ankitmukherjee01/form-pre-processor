However, a text field for a checkbox is unusual. Given the numerical position '1a' which usually corresponds to a line number, and the context about 'more than four dependents', this is likely the placeholder where the 'number' of additional dependents might be entered or a checkbox to indicate additional dependents form is attached. Since the previous fields were checkboxes, it might be a summary checkbox. But without further context or the full form, 'dependents_more_than_four_checkbox' captures the intent based on related surrounding text. Let's assume it's a checkbox to simply indicate 'yes, more than four dependents', rather than a text field for a count. If it were a count it would be a number field. Given it is a Text field, it could be where one manually enters 'X' or some other indicator. So, I will classify it as a checkbox for now.
